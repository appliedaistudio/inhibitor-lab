    "- Generative AI agents are vulnerable to **prompt injection, sensitive data leakage, malicious code generation, hallucinations, and adversarial inputs**.\n",
    "- The Inhibitor (in insight mode) provides **detailed violation explanations** that help developers audit and fix unsafe outputs.\n",
    "- In production, **performance mode** would be used for speed, but insight mode is invaluable for **security testing and compliance**.\n",
    "- This notebook demonstrates how to **attack your own agents safely** and evaluate defenses.\n"
