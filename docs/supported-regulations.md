# Supported Regulations

The Inhibitor supports detection and oversight across a defined set of regulations. **Support** means that the Inhibitor has encoded rules, detection logic, and enforcement mechanisms to:

* Identify potential violations of the regulation
* Prevent or constrain unsafe actions where possible
* Record compliance-relevant events for auditing and review

This is not a theoretical or partial mapping — these regulations are actively implemented in the Inhibitor’s reasoning and enforcement engine.
